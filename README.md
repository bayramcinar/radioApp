# radioApp
In this project, I made a radio app by using HTML, CSS and JS.  I learned using play button and volume control in Javascript. There are different categories on the website such as pop, slow,  arabesque and news & sport. And there is a music player. This project is also responsive which means suitable for mobile devices.

And here there is the website = https://bayramcinar.github.io/radioApp/
